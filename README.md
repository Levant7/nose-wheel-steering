gefs-plugins
============

The un-official repository of user created plugins for GEFS-Online (http://www.gefs-online.com), the free flight simulator based on the Google Earth Plugin.

We recommend using Google Earth Plugin v6.2.2.6613, as later versions use a new terrain data model which makes GEFS unusuable.
